    Classes to define the configuration of models to be used in the eventual HTE analysis.

    These model configurations include valid standard errors and are well suited
    for providing usable output to be plotted or returned for formal inference.

- subtitle: Models for nuisance functions
  desc: >
    These models are most useful for estimating nuisance functions in the course of HTE
    estimation. In particular, `Known_cfg` may be used when the propensity score is
    known ex ante, while `SLEnsemble_cfg` may be used when a SuperLearner ensemble
    of machine learning models should be used to estimate an unknown nuisance function.

- title: Analysis Configuration
  desc: >
    These classes configure the overall shape of the HTE analysis: essentially, how
    all the various components and models should fit together. They explain what models
    should be estimated and how those models should be combined into relevant quantities
    of interest.

- subtitle: Configuration of HTE estimands
  desc: >
    There are two configurations for HTE estimands. `MCATE_cfg` simply provides a one-dimensional
    slice of the effects over a particular dimension. It averages over all other moderators, so does not
    attempt to attribute heterogeneity to particular covariates. `PCATE_cfg`, however, does attempt to do
    this type of attribution. Estimation of these "partial" effects requires strong assumptions, even 
    within the context of a randomized control trial. Essentially, one must assume that the moderator, too,
    is random conditional on treatment and other covariates.
